# Helm Charts from nhtua
Hi, I'm a DevOps engineer. I created this repository to keep my K8s recipe. It basically serves for many tutorials I made on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC64HFdJWvwuNt2ruywWvF-w).

But you're free to use and contribute all Helm charts here. Add this repo to your Helm command.

```
$ helm repo add nhtua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhtua/charts/master/

$ helm search repo nhtua
```

After add repo to Helm, you can start to install chart from this repository.
